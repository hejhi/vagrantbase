# vagrantbase

To initiate your project, run:

$ PROJECT=myprojectname vagrant up

If you ignore the project variable, it will default to 'site'.

Then, just visit http://myprojectname.local to see your site in action. If you didn't set the PROJECT variable, your site will be located at http://site.local.

TODO: allow the changing of project name from config file or environment variable.
